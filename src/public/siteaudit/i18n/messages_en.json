Having duplicate content may significantly affect your SEO performance. First of all, Google will typically show only one duplicate page, filtering other instances out of its index and search results, and this page may not be the one you want to rank. In some cases, search engines may consider duplicate pages as an attempt to manipulate search engine rankings and, as a result, your website may be downgraded or even banned from search results. Moreover, duplicate pages may dilute your link profile. How to fix. Here are a few ways to fix duplicate content issues: 1. Add a rel=\"canonical\" link to one of your duplicate pages to inform search engines which page to show in search results. 2. Use a 301 redirect from a duplicate page to the original one. 3. Use a rel=\"next\" and a rel=\"prev\" link attribute to fix pagination duplicates. 4. Instruct GoogleBot to handle URL parameters differently using Google Search Console. 5. Provide some unique content on the webpage.
